The game is a very simple FPS that you can play with someone over the internet thanks to the PUN (Photon, a tool for networking for Unity) tool. Simply put you appear on the map, and so do others, you shoot each other until someone dies, then they are respawned in the original spot, and you can shoot each other again.
